<h1> Airport</h1>

<p>Before performing any other operations you will require to load an
airport configuration within the application. Airport configurations
can be loaded in a variety of ways:<br>
</p>

<h2> Creating Airport</h2>

<p>If you are a new user, the first action you will perform is creating a new airport configuration to use.<br>
</p>
<p> To create a custom airport click File-&gt;New-&gt;Airport. <br>
</p>
<p>You must
specify both airports name and airports code and add at least one
runway.</p>
<p>
Read more about how to add a runway in the Runway tab.</p>

<h2> Editing Airport</h2>

<p>Once you have created an airport configuration, you may realise that
some of the details you have entered are not correct. In such an event,
you can easily edit the airport configuration at any time.<br>
</p>
<p> To edit an airport click Edit-&gt;Airport. <br>
</p>
<p>The GUI allows to change
airports name, code and edit, add or remove runways.

</p>
<h2> Exporting an Airport</h2>


<p>Now that your airport configuration configuration is correct, it is
a good idea to save this configuration to a file such that it can be
imported at a later date.</p>
<p> To export an airport click File-&gt;Export-&gt;Airport and select
the directory where you want to save the airport xml file.
</p>
<p>All data is saved in XML format.</p>
<p></p>
<h2> Importing Airport</h2>

<p>The application supports the ability to load a previously exported
airport configuration from a file. This is useful as it avoids having
to input the airport parameters each time you use the application.<br>
</p>

<p> To import an Airport from a predefined list of airports click
File-&gt;Import-&gt;Airport and select it from the predefined list.
(the selected file must end with extension .xml)</p>
