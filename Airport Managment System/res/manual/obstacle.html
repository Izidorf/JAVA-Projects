<h1> Obstacle</h1>

Once your runways are set up, obstacles may be added to them. <br>

Each runway may contain up to one obstacle.
<h2> Creating Obstacles</h2>

<p>In order to introduce an obstacle onto the model of our runway, we must load an obstacle onto the runway.</p>
<p>An obstacle can either be defined from scratch or loaded from a set
of predefined obstacles. To do the latter, please see the below section
"Importing Obstacles".</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select the runway you wish to add the obstacle to.</li>
  <li>If an obstacle currently exists, remove the current obstacle from the runway. (See section below "Removing Obstacles").</li>
  <li>Select File -&gt; New -&gt; Obstacle.</li>
  <li>Enter the obstacle height, distance from centerline and distance from designators.</li>
  <li>Click the "Add" button.</li>
</ol>
The new obstacle should be shown within the interface, the parameters
of this obstacle can be viewed in the "Obstacle Information" panel on
the left hand side of the screen.<br>
<h2>Removing Obstacles</h2>

<p>In order to remove obstacles from a runway, the runway must have an obstacle on.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select the runway you wish to remove the obstacle from.</li>
  <li>Click the "Remove" button in the "Obstacle Information" panel on the left hand side of the screen.<br>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2> Editing Obstacles</h2>

<p>Once an obstacle has been loaded, its parameters can be viewed and
changed on the left hand side of the screen within the "Obstacle
Information" panel.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select the desired parameter values and change them by deleting them and putting in the amended values.</li>
  <li>Click upon the "update" button in the "Obstacle Information" panel.<br>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2> Importing Obstacles</h2>

<p>To make the task easier for frequent users, the obstacle may be
selected from a set of pre-defined common objects.</p>

<ol>

  <li>Select File-&gt;Open-&gt;Obstacle.</li>
  <li>Choose the obstacle you desire from the list of XML files.</li>
  <li>Click "open".</li>
</ol>

The obstacle will now be on the runway and can be eddited as normal.<br>

<h2> Saving Obstacles</h2>

Because it is likely that new types of obstacle could frequently
appear, it is useful to be able to export commonly used obstacles to
file.<br>

To do this, first have the desired obstacle configuration upon the
runway.<br>

<br>

<ol>

  <li>Select File-&gt;Save-&gt;Obstacle.</li>
  <li>Choose the file location you wish to export the obstacle to.</li>
  <li>Click "save".<br>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This obstacle can now be reimported at any time by importing it. To
do this, see the above section "Importing Obstacles".<br>
