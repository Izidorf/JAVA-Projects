		<h1>
			Side on View</h1>
		
<p>The right-hand side of the screen will contain the runway
visualisation panels, including the top-down and side-on views. The
side-on view is the visualisation nearest the bottom of the page.</p>

<p>This side-on visualisation gives you a side-on of the runway, as if you were viewing it from alongside.<br>
</p>

<h2>Navigation</h2>

In order to navigate around this view, translate from side to side.<br>

<h3>Translation</h3>

In order to translate the view, you simply LEFT click somewhere upon
the side-on view and drag the mouse in the direction you wish to move
the view in.<br>
The side-on view only allows you to shift the view in a horizontal direction.<br>

<h2>Action Bar</h2>

A convenient feature provided by views is the "action bar". To bring up
the action bar, simply press and release the mouse anywhere within the
view (do not drag the mouse).<br>

This will bring up a set of icons, each with an assosiated task.<br>


<h3>Paint bucket: toggle visualisation texturing<br>
</h3>

The applications default mode is textured.<br>


<h3>Expand: toggle full screen mode<br>
</h3>

Clicking upon the expand button icon will toggle between fullscreen and
non-fullscreen modes. This is useful for getting a more detailed look
at the side-on view.<br>
