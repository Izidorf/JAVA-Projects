<h1>Manual</h1>

<p>Welcome to the Runway Redeclaration System (RRS) manual.</p>

<p>Runway Redeclaration System is a software package which allows
managing several runways within an airport. <br>
The primary concern of the system is to recalculate the redeclared
runway parameters when an obstacle is present on the runway and to
visualise this clearly for the user.<br>
RRS is not designd to replace traditional runway redeclaration
practices, but rather to support the individuals involved with the
process and assist in the training of personel who are unfamiliar with
the domain.</p>

<h2>Interface Navigation<br>
</h2>

<p>Upon opening the interface you will see several different panels. To
make it clear we will go through the purpose of each area to help you
understand the interface.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The left hand panel is the data panel. It is used to display and
modify the basic details of the runway, obstacle and calculations
currently being performed.</li>
  <li>The right hand panels are the runway visualisations. This includes the top-down and side-on views.</li>
  <li>The menu bar, at the top of the screen. This contains several
drop-down menus: "File", "Edit", "View", "Accessibility" and "Help".</li>
</ol>
Now that you are familiar with the basic interface, you should
configure the system to use your airport of choice. To do so, see the
"Managing Airports" section.<br>
