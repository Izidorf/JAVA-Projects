<h1>Frequently Asked Questions<br>
</h1>

<p>Below is a list of problems users might frequently ask about the
program.<br>
</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;">I accidentally entered the airport details incorrectly, can I correct this without starting from scratch?<br>
</h3>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Yes, at any time you can edit the airport configuration by selecting<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Edit -&gt; Airport</span>.</p>
<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;">The file I'm trying to import is showing an error "Invalid XML file". How can I fix this?</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Make sure than you are selecting the correct file to load, this must be in XML format and be the right kind of data.<br>
For example, loading an&nbsp; airport from an obstacle XML file will not work.<br>
If the file you are selecting is the right one, your file may have been
corrupted. Re-enter the values manually and export the file again to
fix this.</p>
<h2>Calculations</h2>
<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;">I do not understand the calculations being done, any way I can see a break down of what is happening?</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Yes, to view a break down of what is happening you must select the calculations tab at the top right-hand side of the screen.<br>
You will then be shown a textual breakdown of the calculations being performed. <br>
<h3>Can I export the calculation breakdown for later use?</h3>
Yes, calculations can be exported to text file format. To do this,
simply bring up the calculations you want to export and select <span style="font-weight: bold;">File -&gt; Export -&gt; Calculations</span>.<br>
You can then select the text file you wish to export to.<br>
